			<h1>ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
			<div id="ab">
				<p>World of Tanks is a team-based massively multiplayer online action game dedicated to armoured warfare. Throw yourself into the epic tank battles of World War II with other steel cowboys from all over the world. Your arsenal includes more than 220 armoured vehicles from America, Germany, France and the Soviet Union, carefully detailed with historical accuracy. A flexible system of authentic vehicle upgrade and development allows you to try any of the vehicles and weapons in the game. Whether you prefer to exhaust your foes with fast and maneuverable light tanks, make deep breaches in enemy lines with all-purpose medium tanks, use the force of giant heavy tanks to eliminate opposing armoured forces, or become a heavy sniper with long-range howitzers, each unit type has its own advantages and can be extremely effective when operated by a true tank ace. But being a great tank commander alone isn't enough to win! In World of Tanks, it’s all about teamwork. Victory is achieved by combining your combat skills with those of the other members of your team, each playing their own role on the battlefield. Just add your favorite strategy to build your own iron empire and display the indisputable authority of the power of the tank! New players can jump into battle in less than a minute to take part in short, decisive combat actions designed to ensure fast and action-oriented warfare. As you are thrown onto the battlefield, you must be bold, decisive and flexible to succeed in the maelstrom of iron and fire-based warfare. Dive into intense tank-on-tank combat to enjoy an amazing new battlefield experience that provides a combination of multiple genres. A unique blend of gameplay "ingredients,” supported by top-notch graphics and stunning audio-visual effects, provides endless challenge and excitement. Simulator. Authentic models and vehicle characteristics make you feel like a real tank commander taking part in a furious armored offensive. RPG. Your armored steed isn't just a tin can on tracks - it’s a living, evolving mechanism that should be treated accordingly. Research your available upgrades and modifications to enhance its performance on the battlefield. Action. Take part in joint operations to spot, track, and destroy enemy units and engage in head-on-head duels where your speed and reaction time is as important as in any co-op shooter. Strategy. There’s only one simple rule to follow - don't be a loner. Rally your comrades to devise a battle plan and assign roles, then move out and defeat your enemy on the field of honor. </p>
